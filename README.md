You need to create a Python class Book with the following specifications:
Each book has a id, title, year, author, price, and discount (all provided when the book is
created).
The id of each book follows a specific format: the first two characters should be letters,
and the last two should be digits (e.g., "AB12"). If the ID is not valid, raise a ValueError.
The class should include a method to calculate the total price of the book. The total price
is calculated as the book’s price minus the discount.
Include a method that prints how many books have been created.
Implement the __str__ method that returns a string representing the book’s details in
the following format: "Title: {title}, Author: {author}, Year: {year}, Price: {total_price}".
